# Installing the Tool Chain

h2. Using the ZIP file

The ZIP file distribution is the easiest way to get started using {project_name:} to set up a DocBook XML project. All you need 
to do is upack the distribution and your project is set up and ready to go. The distrobution includes the following folders:
* @common@ - keywords and entities that are used for all books in the library
* @conventions@ - sample legal notices and typographical conventions that are intended to be shared among all the books 
in the library
* @getting_started@ - a sample book
* @install_guide@ - a sample book
* @template@ - the DocBook XML tool chain
** @catalog@ - the catalog file used to look up files in the tool chain
** @custom@ - the customization layer that modifies how the content is generated
** @lib@ - the static part of the tool chain including the XSLT processor, the FO processor, and the XSLT stylesheets
* @site.xml@ - the olink site map for HTML content generation
* @sitepdf.xml@ - the olink site map for PDF content generation

h2. Using SVN

If you use Subversion for source control you can either check out copies of the tool chain or you can use @svn:external@ 
to import the static parts of the tool chain directly from the project's SVN repository.

The static portion of the tool chain can be accessed at:
* http://fusesource.com/forge/svn/forgedp/trunk/lib for the bulk of the tool chain
* http://fusesource.com/forge/svn/forgedp/trunk/catalog for the catalog file used to resolve the style sheets

The customization layer can be accessed at: http://fusesource.com/forge/svn/forgedp/trunk/custom[1]

These three folders should be placed inside a @template@ folder that is a peer with the book folders.

The @custom@ folder includes copies of the Apache Ant build files needed to build books:
* @build_book.xml@ - build file for books that do not use profiling
* @build_book_with_conditions.xml@ - build file for books the use profiling

These files should be copied to the folders of each book and modified appropriately.

fn1. The @custom@ folder should be exported and not checked out. The intended use of this folder is that you will 
modify the templates to fit the needs of your own library.
