Get the {project_name:} source code

--- name:content 

The {project_name:} project stores its source code in a [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/)
 repository at: 

  [{project_svn_url:}]({project_svn_url:})

The source tree is organized as follows:
<ul>
<li>catalog - the XML catalog used by the tool chain</li>
<li>custom - the XSLT and build scripts that make up the customization layer.</li>
<li>lib - the binaries and base DocBook XSL-NS style sheets</li>
<li>sample - the sample DocBook XML library with two books</li>
<li>site - the source code used to generate the project Web site</li>
</ul>

## Old Versions

We use the trunk for the next main release; then we use a branch for any bug fixes on the previous major release. You can look at a specific branch here:

  [{project_svn_branches_url:}]({project_svn_branches_url:})
  


## Checking Out

Check out the {project_name:} source using the following command:

`svn co {project_svn_url:} {project_id:}`
