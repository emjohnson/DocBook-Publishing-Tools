# Source
Get the {project_name:} source code

--- name:content 

The {project_name:} project stores its source code in a [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/)
 repository at: 

  [{project_svn_url:}]({project_svn_url:})
  
We use the trunk for the next main release; then we use a branch for any bug fixes on the previous major release. You can look at a specific branch here:

  [{project_svn_branches_url:}]({project_svn_branches_url:})
  


## Checking Out

Check out the {project_name:} source using the following command:

`svn co {project_svn_url:} {project_id:}`
